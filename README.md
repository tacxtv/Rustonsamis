- **Community Interaction:** Built-in features for community engagement such as forums, chat rooms, and events calendar.
- **Server Integration:** Integration with the Rust server to display in-game events, server status, and player statistics.
- **Customization:** Options for users to customize their profiles, follow other streamers, and personalize their experience on the platform.
